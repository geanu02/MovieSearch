# Movie Search Web Application

## Movie Database Search with Synopsis and Release Date

Built the frontend UI of a movie database search engine using React that enables searching for titles with synopsis and release date information. Under the hood, the API from The Movie DB was utilized to extract movie data titles and information. Applied modern web standards in Single-Page Application (SPA) using React.js functional components, built-in/custom hooks and JavaScript ES6+ for fetch calls. Deployed the web application on Netlify through Github to enable CI/CD.
